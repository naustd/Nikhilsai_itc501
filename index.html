          Guided Imagery and progressive Muscle Relaxation in Group
          Psychotherapy
        </center>
      </h1>
      <p>
        A majority of Americans experience stress in their daily lives (American
        Psychological Association,2017).Thus, an important goal of psychological
        research is to evaluate techniques that promote stress reduction and
        relaxation. Two techniques that have been associated with reduced stress
        and increased relaxation in psychotherapy contexts are guided imagery
        and progressive muscle relaxation (McGuigan & Lehrer,2007).
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Guided imagery</i> aids individuals in connecting their internal and
        external experiences, allowing them, for example, to feel calmer
        externally because they practice thinking about calming imagery.
        <i>Progressive muscle relaxation</i> involves diaphragmatic breathing
        and tensing and releasing of 16 major muscle groups; together these
        behaviors lead individuals to a more relaxed state (Jacobson, 1938;
        Trakhtenberg, 2008). Guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation
        are both cognitive behavioral techniques (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005) in which
        individuals focus on the relationship among thoughts, emotions, and
        behaviors(White, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
        Group psychotherapy effectively promotes positive treatment outcomes in
        patients in a cost- effective way. Its efficacy is in part attributable
        to variables unique to the group experience of therapy as compared with
        individual psychotherapy (Bottomley, 1996;Yalom & Leszcz,2005). That is,
        the group format helps participants feel accepted and better their
        common struggles; at the same time, interactions with group members
        provide social support and models of positive behavior (Yalom & Leszcz,
        2005). Thus, it is useful to examine how stress reduction and relaxation
        can be enhanced in a group context.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this literature review is to examine the research base on
        guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation in group psychotherapy
        contexts. I provide overviews of both guided imagery and progressive
        muscle relaxation, including theoretical foundations and historical
        context. Then I examine guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation
        as used on their own as well as in combination as part of group
        psychotherapy (see Baider et al., 1994,for more).
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the review, I highlight themes in the research. Finally, I
        end by pointing out limitations in the existing literature and exploring
        potential directions for future research.

        <center>Guided Imagery</center>
      </h1>
      <h3>Features of Guided Imagery:</h3>
      <p>
        Guided imagery involves a person visualizing a mental image and engaging
        each sense (e.g., sight, smell, touch) in the process. Guided imagery
        was first examined in a psychological context in the 1960s, when the
        behavior theorist Joseph Wolpe helped pioneer the use of relaxation
        techniques such as aversive imagery, exposure, and imaginal flooding in
        behavior therapy (Achterberg, 1985; Utay & Miller, 2006). Patients learn
        to relax their bodies in the presence of stimuli that previously
        distressed them, to the point where further exposure to the stimuli no
        longer provokes a negative response (Achterberg, 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
        Contemporary research supports the efficacy of guided imagery
        interventions for treating medical, psychiatric, and psychological
        disorders (Utay & Miller, 2006). Guided imagery is typically used to
        pursue treatment goals such as improved relaxation, sports achievement,
        and pain reduction. Guided imagery techniques are often paired with
        breathing techniques and other forms of relaxation, such as mindfulness
        (see Freebird Meditations, 2012). The evidence is sufficient to call
        guided imagery an effective, evidence-based treatment for a variety of
        stress-related psychological concerns (Utay & Miller, 2006).
